**TWG:BAM** is a third-person "reverse rogue-like" played by a wizard who escaped a inter-dimensional prison through a portal and landed into a futuristic alleyway. But beware! A prison warden followed you through the portal. Fight your way through the alleys of dystopian New York while evading the warden.
