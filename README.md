## Tale of the Wand Guy: Back-Alley Magic

A third-person, reverse roguelike, played by a wizard who escaped a magical prison through a portal and landed into a futuristic alleyway. But beware! The prison warden followed you through the portal. Fight your way through the alleys of dystopian New York while evading the warden.

The game takes place in a dystopian alternative Manhattan alleyway. The player is an outcast, high-class wizard, who broke out from an interdimensional prison, and the prison’s warden (a creepy spirit creature who can drain others' souls to weaken them) has taken chase. The player’s health depletes as they continuously run from the warden, but the player also gains lost spells throughout the run.
